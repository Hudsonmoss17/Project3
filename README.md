# Title:

	Motors for Mens Health Festival

# Project Overview:

	Motors for Mens Health aims to bring awareness to Men's health issues such as testicular and prostate cancer and mental health. We are working with the Movember team and donating all funds to their charity. This website was built to help promote, spread awareness, and to sell tickets for the event. 

# Technical Overview:

    By using Flexboxes and accurately styling each word, I created a site that is very clean and easy to read while still putting detail into every page.
